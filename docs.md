the intention is to create a journal app;

=> i think that the app should be much simpler, the app should simply track how many hours the user is spending on doing the task that he had scheduled to do , then simply add up how many hours he had done it this week , this month so a monthly a yearly graph , just keep adding up the hours,

=> when the task saved is equal to any other task already saved then the number of hours simply get added to the previous task,

=> the next challenge will be to create graphs dynamically with the available data, 


28th march 2025

i want the edit-modal to open when we click the graph lines or even the bar graph , that isn't happening,


users 
1. {username:doraemon,email:doraemon@gmail.com,password:"doraemonisanidiot"}
2. {username:chhota-bheem,email:chhota-bheem@gmail.com,password:chhota-bheem-from-dholakpur}
3. {username:"r",email:"r@gmail.com",password:"r-password"}


=> sign-up page will be our first page,
=> then the login page,
=> if they are signed up for them only the login page will appear (i don't how i will achieve that),
=> once they are logged in everything else will be same, they can get task/tasks,create task , update task, delete task, 

=> let's start by creating the sign-up and login page,

=> useEffect is used to deal with the systems which are not part of the react ecosystem,
